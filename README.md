# Entropy Game Theory (EGT)

This repository accompanies the paper:

**Entropy Game Theory: A Unified Framework for Strategic Collapse,  
Diversity Dynamics, and Platform Ecosystem Reconfiguration**

## Overview
Entropy Game Theory (EGT) is a theoretical framework modeling how competitive
systems can undergo endogenous collapse due to entropy–payoff co-evolution,
even in the absence of external shocks.

## Contents
- `/figures/` – Code to reproduce all main figures in the paper
- `/simulations/` – Entropy-adjusted replicator and network simulations
- `/si/` – Supplementary analyses (consumer-level entropy, robustness checks)
- `/data/` – Metadata or links to external datasets (no raw proprietary data)

## Reproducibility
All figures can be reproduced using Python ≥ 3.8 with NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib,
and NetworkX. Random seeds are fixed where applicable.

## Status
This repository corresponds to **version v14 (Dec 2025)** of the manuscript
submitted to *Advanced Science*.
